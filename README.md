# snowflakes
some fractal-like flakes

this is a little program which creates smowflake-like elements on a html canvas element.
the algorithms are quite simple and based on a recursive subdivision of up to 9 symmetrically ordered rays of a star.

how to run it:
just download the two files and put it in the same directory.
open the .html.
click 'Refresh' to create new flakes.
